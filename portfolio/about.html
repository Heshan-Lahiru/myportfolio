            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is K.B.L. Lahiru Heshan, currently pursuing studies at IUHS Campus. Having successfully completed my O/L and A/L exams, I have focused my academic journey on IT subjects, mastering a range of languages and technologies including HTML, CSS, PHP, Java, C, and the MERN stack (Node.js, React.js, Express.js, MongoDB). I am proficient in MySQL and have foundational knowledge in Go, Rust, and Python. Utilizing VS Code, I have developed websites and employed Android Studio to create mobile applications. Currently, I am expanding my skills in Go language under the guidance of Indian software engineer Gunjan Tank. Alongside my studies, I mentor students in web development languages and am actively engaged in a collaborative project with a partner in Dubai, focusing on Python for her final project.</p>
